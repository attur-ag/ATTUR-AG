                we believe in the supremacy of God’s Word and the power of the Holy Spirit. We are thankful to the Lord
                for the increase
                He has brought, and through the years, the church continues to grow in number and spiritual maturity.
            </p>
            <p> We are thankful to the Lord for the increase he has brought about in the last 13 years
                as the church has grown from a group of few individuals to a congregation of about 300 people
                coming to worship the Lord every Sunday</p>

                <h1 class="op">Assemblies of God Fundamental Truths</h1>
                <b>
                    <p> 1.WE BELIEVE…The Scriptures are Inspired by God and declare His design and plan for mankind.</p>
                    <P> 2.WE BELIEVE…There is only One True God–revealed in three persons…Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
                        (commonly
                        known as the Trinity)</P>

                    <P>3. WE BELIEVE…In the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. As God’s son Jesus was both human and
                        divine.
                    </P>

                    <P>4. WE BELIEVE…though originally good, Man Willingly Fell to Sin–ushering evil and death, both
                        physical
                        and spiritual, into the world.</p>

                    <p>5.WE BELIEVE…Every Person Can Have Restored Fellowship with God through ‘Salvation’ (trusting
                        Christ,
                        through faith and repentance, to be our personal Savior). [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG]
                    </P>

                    <P>6.WE BELIEVE…and practice two ordinances—(1) Water Baptism by Immersion after repenting of one’s
                        sins
                        and
                        receiving Christ’s gift of salvation, and (2) Holy Communion (the Lord’s Supper) as a symbolic
                        remembrance of Christ’s suffering and death for our salvation.
                    <P>7.WE BELIEVE…the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a Special Experience Following Salvation that
                        empowers
                        believers for witnessing and effective service, just as it did in New Testament times. [1 of 4
                        cardinal
                        doctrines of the AG]</P>
                    <P>8.WE BELIEVE… The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is ‘Speaking in
                        Tongues,’
                        as experienced on the Day of Pentecost and referenced throughout Acts and the Epistles.</P>
                    <P>9.WE BELIEVE…Sanctification Initially Occurs at Salvation and is not only a declaration that a
                        believer
                        is holy, but also a progressive lifelong process of separating from evil as believers
                        continually
                        draw
                        closer to God and become more Christ-like.</P>
                    <P>10.WE BELIEVE…The Church has a Mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin. We believe ‘the
                        Church’
                        is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who, throughout time, have accepted God’s offer
                        of
                        redemption (regardless of religious denomination) through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus
                        Christ.</p>
                    <P>11.WE BELIEVE…A Divinely Called and Scripturally Ordained Leadership Ministry serves the Church.
                        The
                        Bible teaches that each of us under leadership must commit ourselves to reach others for Christ,
                        to
                        worship
                        Him with other believers, to build up or edify the body of believers–the Church and to Meet
                        human
                        need with
                        ministries of love and compassion.</p>
                    <P>12.WE BELIEVE…Divine Healing of the Sick is a Privilege for Christians today and is provided for
                        in
                        Christ’s atonement (His sacrificial death on the cross for our sins).</P>
                    <P>13.WE BELIEVE…in The Blessed Hope—When Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His Return to Earth
                        (the
                        second coming). At this future moment in time all believers who have died will rise from their
                        graves and
                        will meet the Lord in the air, and Christians who are alive will be caught up with them, to be
                        with
                        the Lord
                        forever.</P>
                    <P>14.WE BELIEVE…in The Millennial Reign of Christ when Jesus returns with His saints at His second
                        coming
                        and begins His benevolent rule over earth for 1,000 years. This millennial reign will bring the
                        salvation of
                        national Israel and the establishment of universal peace.</P>
                    <P>15.WE BELIEVE…A Final Judgment Will Take Place for those who have rejected Christ. They will be
                        judged
                        for their sin and consigned to eternal punishment in a punishing lake of fire.</P>
                    <P>16.WE BELIEVE…and look forward to the perfect New Heavens and a New Earth that Christ is
                        preparing
                        for
                        all people, of all time, who have accepted Him. We will live and dwell with Him there forever
                        following His
                        millennial reign on Earth. ‘And so shall we forever be with the Lord!’</p>
